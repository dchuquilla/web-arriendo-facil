# Arriendo Fácil

A WordPress plugin that manages accommodations and provides a complete rental-management platform including:

- **Lease management** – Create and manage rental contracts linked to accommodations and guests, with lifecycle statuses (*draft → active → expired/terminated*).
- **Owner contact** – Send and track messages directed to property owners, with email notification on receipt.
- **Guest management** – Maintain guest profiles including identity data, with AI-powered scoring.
- **AI-powered features**
  - **Cost prediction** – Predict the recommended monthly rental cost for an accommodation.

## AI Integration

The plugin communicates with OpenAI ChatGPT via the Chat Completions API. Configure your OpenAI API key in **Arriendo Fácil → AI Settings**.

- Default endpoint used by the plugin: `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
- Optional override: `AI API URL` setting (advanced use)
- Required credential: OpenAI API key

Expected responses:

| Action              | Response key(s)                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `predict_cost`      | `predicted_cost`                     |
| `generate_document` | `document_url`                       |

All AI interactions are logged in the `wp_af_ai_logs` database table.
